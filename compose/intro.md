In this tutorial we'll build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. While the sample uses Python, the concepts demonstrated here should be understandable even if youâ€™re not familiar with it. It's based on Mark Bradley's tutorial that can be found here - https://github.com/braddle/osf-resources/tree/main/006-containers/ComposeDemo

NB. The Killercoda platform is using an older version of docker so you'll see the docker compose commands shown as docker-compose in real life please use an upto date version and the docker compose syntax.
