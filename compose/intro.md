In this tutorial we'll build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. While the sample uses Python, the concepts demonstrated here should be understandable even if youâ€™re not familiar with it. It's based on Mark Bradley's tutorial that can be found here - https://github.com/braddle/osf-resources/tree/main/006-containers/ComposeDemo
