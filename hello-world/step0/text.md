We're going to be using the Docker CLI in these labs. It's powerful so there are lots of subcommands to get familar with. Fortuantly it iseasy to use and has built in help. Try running `docker --help` to get an idea of whats available. The subcommand for running containers is run, try displaying
the help for that command.  

To access the built in help for any command just execute the command, followed by the --help option.
